# Facial_Emotion_detection

This is a project on detecting facial emotions using machine learning.

Modelling is done using transfer learning with MobileNet weights.

The data initially was very imbalanced among 7 emotion classes : Happy, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Contempt. 

This project has employed Conditional GAN models to augment the data and reduce the imbalance in it.
